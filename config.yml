      Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Oleksandr, As a junior React Developer, I am at the beginning of an exciting
      journey in web development, driven by a passion for creating dynamic and
      user-friendly web applications. I am currently focused on mastering
      React and its ecosystem, including tools like Redux for state management
      and React Hooks for building efficient reusable components and React Native for mobile development.

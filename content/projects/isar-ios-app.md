The Isar app is a real-world iOS application developed as part of my work in a product team. I contributed to the project as a React Native developer, focusing on performance, clean architecture, and UI consistency. The app is live and in use, built and maintained through a structured development process under guidance from a team lead.

### Technology Stack

#### React Native (iOS-focused):
- Core framework used to build the app for Apple devices, ensuring native-like performance and a smooth UX.

#### TypeScript:
- Added strong typing across the codebase to reduce runtime errors and improve maintainability.

#### React Navigation:
- Used to implement consistent and intuitive navigation across app screens.

#### Expo:
- Utilized for streamlined development and easy deployment to iOS devices.

#### AsyncStorage:
- Employed for storing persistent local data such as user preferences.

#### ESLint + Prettier:
- Configured pre-commit tools to enforce clean, consistent code.

### Development Highlights

- Worked within an agile team, implementing features and improvements based on assigned tickets

- Optimized for iOS design patterns and platform guidelines

- Built modular UI components and reusable hooks for better scalability

- Followed best practices for version control, code review, and linting

- Regular testing on real devices to ensure stability and user satisfaction

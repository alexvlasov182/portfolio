This portfolio site was crafted for Anastasiia to showcase her skills, projects, and experience as a product designer. The primary goal was to create an intuitive and visually appealing platform that reflects her design philosophy and professional background.

### Technology Stack

- **React**: The application was built using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for efficient rendering and reusability of UI components, making it an excellent choice for developing dynamic web applications.

- **React Router**: To manage navigation within the site, React Router was employed. This library enables the creation of a single-page application with multiple views, ensuring a seamless user experience as visitors navigate through different sections of the portfolio.

- **CSS Modules**: For styling the components, CSS Modules were utilized. This approach provides scoped styles, preventing class name collisions and making the CSS easier to manage. It allows for modular and maintainable styling, which is especially beneficial for larger projects.
